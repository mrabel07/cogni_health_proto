# Privacy Policy
_Last updated: 2025-08-10_

Abenivate LLC operates my_fitbit_proto (the “Service”).

## 1. Scope 
We use Fitbit data solely to provide and improve user-visible health/fitness features such as journaling, reporting, monitoring, analysis, and syncing of your own data. We do not use Fitbit data for advertising or sell it to third parties. We request only the permissions needed for these features, and you can revoke access at any time by disconnecting the app in your Fitbit account settings.

## Security

### Secure Data Handling
We take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect Fitbit data against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure, and to ensure security **in transit** and **at rest**.

### Required Security Measures
- **Encryption of user data** with an industry-accepted standard when data is:
  - stored on portable devices or portable electronic media;
  - maintained outside of Google’s, Fitbit’s, or our systems;
  - transferred across any external network not solely managed by us; and
  - **at rest** on our systems.
- **Secure transport:** transmit all data using modern secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS/TLS).
- **Credentials at rest:** store user credentials—specifically OAuth access and refresh tokens—**encrypted at rest**.
- **Key management:** protect cryptographic keys and key material (e.g., HSM or equivalent-strength key management); separate keys from encrypted data; rotate and revoke keys appropriately.

### Prototype Notice
While this is a prototype, we are committed to improving safeguards over time and to minimizing data retention consistent with the purposes described in this Policy.

## 3. Data we process
- **Fitbit data you authorize** (e.g., heart rate, steps, sleep; depends on scopes you grant).
- **Technical data** (e.g., logs for security/debugging).
- **User-provided info** (e.g., voluntary feedback).
- This may evolve with time and the policy will be updated accordingly 

## 4. How we use data
Provide and improve the Service, visualize metrics, debug, and secure the system. We do **not** sell personal information.

## 5. Legal basis / consent
For invited testers, we rely on your **explicit consent**. You can revoke access at any time.

## 6. Sharing
We may share data with service providers under confidentiality, Fitbit/Google as required by your authorized API use, and law enforcement if required by law. We do not share data with advertisers.

## 7. Retention
We retain personal data only as long as needed for the purposes above or as required by law. You may request deletion when a contact channel is available (see “Changes” below).

## 9. Your choices
- **Revoke Fitbit access:** Open your Fitbit account settings and remove/disable the app’s access to your data. This prevents further data pulls.
- **Local data:** You may delete local data stored on your device by uninstalling the app or clearing its storage.

## 10. International transfers
Data may be processed in other countries with different data-protection laws.

## 11. Changes
We may update this Policy; the “Last updated” date reflects the latest version. A dedicated contact channel for privacy requests may be added in a future update.
